**Instructions**
The object of Tic Tac Toe is to get three in a row. The standard format for gameplay is based on aa three by three game board. But, because mine is awesome, you can play a grid as large as you want. The first player is known as X and the second is O. Players alternate placing Xs and Os on the game board until either opponent has three in a row or all nine squares are filled. If no one achieve 3 in a row, the stalemate is called a cat game.
